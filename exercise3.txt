1. The first function locks a then b, and the second function locks b then a. If these
   2 threads reach the first lock in their respective functions before the other
   thread reaches the second lock in its respective function, then we will have created
   deadlock.

2. The program is unable to terminate.

3. The program cannot terminate because both functions are waiting for the other
   one to release the other lock (thread 1 is waiting for thread 2 to unlock b, and
   thread 2 is waiting for thread 1 to unlock a).
